# SeptembRSE 2021 Streamlit Workshop


### 10am Monday 20 September 2021

Welcome to this workshop on Streamlit!

Streamlit claims to be "the fastest way to build and share data apps", and they may well be right.
The speed and ease with which you can create interactive web apps and deploy them (for free) sets streamlit apart from other tools.

It is absolutely feasible to create a high-quality and responsive interactive app to showcase data or other visualisations in as little as a few hours, and for that reason I think Streamlit should be in the toolkit of every researcher who wants to share their work with the world.

I am not affiliated with Streamlit in any way.
I just think it's a great tool!
